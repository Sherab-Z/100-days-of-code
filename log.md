### Day 1: March 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I've worked on my 'Rock-Paper-Scissors + UI' project, and made massive progress! It has a few bugs, but I've been bashing them one-by-one all day...going great!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I feel really confident about my ability to find and fix bugs, and to write well-structured, well-doc'd code! I'm making excellent progress! :)
