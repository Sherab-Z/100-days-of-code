### Day 1: March 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I've worked on my 'Rock-Paper-Scissors + UI' project, and made massive progress! It has a few bugs, but I've been bashing them one-by-one all day...going great!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I feel really confident about my ability to find and fix bugs, and to write well-structured, well-doc'd code! I'm making excellent progress! :)

### Day 2: March 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bunch of bugs in js app; removed abstraction that was bloating a function and causing bugs - went from 2 functions with 20 lines of code, to 1 function with 2 lines(!).

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: The 'WET then DRY' Principle: 'Write Everything Twice, then Don't Repeat Yourself' - Only after you've copy-pasted a few times, should you abstract your code to make it more reusable. Otherwise you can waste your time making everything into an abstraction that never gets reused.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Confident about my pontential and my progress, but very nervous and angry about my family situation 'holding me back' from being able to make progress and reach being job-ready...

### Day 3: March 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not much - only had 50m in the day, then a sleepy 30m after girls in bed. But managed to eliminate a bunch of tasks that actually didn't need to be done, and started the 'display scores on UI' feature...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to use the *rest parameter syntax* ( function myFunc(...myArg) {here's the rest} ) to allow a function to recieve any number of arguments and automatically convert them to an array for passing into the function body

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Proud that I'm still able to make a little progress towards my goals on a day when we struggled so much as a family.

### Day 4: March 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished re-build & adding UI for 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game! At least, the game logic is sound...the styling still needs some work..

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Always start with an MVP! The *tiniest* change can take a loooong time to implement, and can break other features...

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired, slightly numb, but proud that I've reached my goal..and happy that I can now move on with the Odin course!

### Day 5: March 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started Etch-a-Sketch project. Already setup with git, and I went through other ss top-rated live examples for inspiration, noted my ideas and made a plan, then started writing that in my pseudo.md

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Never try to develop when you're tired...but if you have to, then at least only do light work like this ;)

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm SUPER tired, literally falling asleep right now as I type...but it's great that I'm doing this 100DaysOfCode challenge, bc otherwise I def wouldn't be keeping up this much momentum!
