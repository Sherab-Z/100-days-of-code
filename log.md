### Day 1: March 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I've worked on my 'Rock-Paper-Scissors + UI' project, and made massive progress! It has a few bugs, but I've been bashing them one-by-one all day...going great!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I feel really confident about my ability to find and fix bugs, and to write well-structured, well-doc'd code! I'm making excellent progress! :)

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 2: March 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bunch of bugs in js app; removed abstraction that was bloating a function and causing bugs - went from 2 functions with 20 lines of code, to 1 function with 2 lines(!).

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: The 'WET then DRY' Principle: 'Write Everything Twice, then Don't Repeat Yourself' - Only after you've copy-pasted a few times, should you abstract your code to make it more reusable. Otherwise you can waste your time making everything into an abstraction that never gets reused.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Confident about my pontential and my progress, but very nervous and angry about my family situation 'holding me back' from being able to make progress and reach being job-ready...

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 3: March 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not much - only had 50m in the day, then a sleepy 30m after girls in bed. But managed to eliminate a bunch of tasks that actually didn't need to be done, and started the 'display scores on UI' feature...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to use the *rest parameter syntax* ( function myFunc(...myArg) {here's the rest} ) to allow a function to recieve any number of arguments and automatically convert them to an array for passing into the function body

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Proud that I'm still able to make a little progress towards my goals on a day when we struggled so much as a family.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 4: March 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished re-build & adding UI for 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game! At least, the game logic is sound...the styling still needs some work..

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Always start with an MVP! The *tiniest* change can take a loooong time to implement, and can break other features...

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired, slightly numb, but proud that I've reached my goal..and happy that I can now move on with the Odin course!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 5: March 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started Etch-a-Sketch project. Already setup with git, and I went through other ss top-rated live examples for inspiration, noted my ideas and made a plan, then started writing that in my pseudo.md

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Never try to develop when you're tired...but if you have to, then at least only do light work like this ;)

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm SUPER tired, literally falling asleep right now as I type...but it's great that I'm doing this 100DaysOfCode challenge, bc otherwise I def wouldn't be keeping up this much momentum!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 6: March 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed my plan for building the 'Etch-a-Sketch' project - wrote up pseudo.md

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Project planning at the beginning, drawing a sketch on paper, breaking down the task into smaller pieces and working out the steps in each one

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Much more confident about starting this project than previous ones

1. https://github.com/Sherab-Z/etch-a-sketch


------------------------------------------------------

### Day 7: March 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Made a more detailed wireframe with html elements, id's and classes, etc. And started building out the html - which went a lot faster and smoother due to the above planning I've put in.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Putting the time in to make a proper plan before I start writing the code...

**Thoughts & Feelings**: The increased confidence from having a more precise and detailed plan is massive!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 8: March 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Made basic layout work using position: absolute and flexbox. Began building JS canvas grid feature.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: CSS layouts, AI help.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Been slow today due to my overwhelming sadness I'm feeling due to traumas. But still  made progress.

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 9: March 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built drawOnCanvas() function with help of ChatGPT, with a lot of prompting back and forth

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to write and debug a function using chatGPT. It's not actually as easy as it seems.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Glad that I'm incorporating AI tools into my learning, both to learn faster and to get ready to use these tools irl.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 1: March 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed a feature on the Etch-a-Sketch project: New Canvas btn now prompts user for their choice of pen thickeness and validates it, then app converts this into a grid side lenght number, and creates a new canvas from that.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: JS functions, event handlers, state management

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Gutted that I missed posting my code to Twitter for 2 days, so I'm starting over again. But I did do 1h of coding each day, so that's good.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 2: March 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I tried building settings button that cycles between 4 pen width options, but realized it will take a lot more thought than I first realized. My code became buggy as hell, so I git reset it. Oh well.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Always, always, ALWAYS plan a feature before you start building it!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Somewhat demoralized & frustrated, but I'm learning. And the pressure is on to start earning from this stuff, so that's not helping me to learn well...

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 3: March 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added a pen width button and icons that resize responsively based on the canvas size. Took a long time to do just that, and the button still doesn't do anything!

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to resize an element responsively based on the size of another element.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Feels good to be able to read through my code and pretty-much know what's going on everywhere. Also frustrating that I haven't planned this project out very well again, but issues and ideas have been occurring along the way which I didn't have enough experience to anticipate at the start.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 4: March 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed my project and pushed it to main remote branch, and moved on to the next chapter on Objects and Arrays in The Odin Project.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Basics of Objects, and Array methods for...in, map, filter, sort, key in obj

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I've covered quite a bit today, even though I only did small bits of actual coding. It was quite a good learning day!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 5: March 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the reading and started the Assignment for Fundamentals 5 chapter on Odin.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Practiced using array methods on Wes Bos JS 30 course: reduce, some, every, find, and findIndex.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Upbeat and confident in my coding skills. It was pretty easy to apply the methods, the hard part is figuring out what the actual problem is I'm trying to solve, breaking it down into smaller chunks/steps, and only THEN building effective solutions to each one - basically, PSEUDOCODE.

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 6: March 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started & completed 09-palindromes exercise in JS Arrays practice. I coded it without array methods at first - and passed all the tests - not being sure which array methods to use. Then I watched a video by Mosh on map() method, and he used it with filter() first, and I realized that's what I could use to refactor my code - and it works perfectly, and is much easier to read!

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: map() and filter() methods for JS arrays

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm happy that I'm growing my understanding of what's actually going underneath the code and it's top-level functionalities, into the underlying logic that runs it - data types, this method copies vs modifies an array, etc.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 7: March 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed ex. 10_fibonacci, from start to finish this time :)

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Array methods: slice, reduce, push, pop. Using a combo of array methods to manipulate an array to produce the result I need, and doing so largely in my head! 

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Gaining confidence in working with arrays!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 8: March 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: It's saturday, so I've been out with family and only started programming after 9pm. So my brain is mush. I managed to complete an easy array function-building exercise - getTheBook(), which takes an array of book objects and returns an array of the titles (used map method). But then spent over 45m staring at the screen not being able to figure out getTheOldest using reduce or sort().pop(). 

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Array.map(), Array.reduce(), Array.sort()

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Frustrated that I spent so long getting nothing done, but accepting more that I just CANT do this after 9pm, especially after spending a long time with my family (Mila in particular)

### Day 11: March 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Setup and created an overview plan for the Calculator PROJECT

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Using CLI to manage files, setting up a git repo locally & remotely, planning out a project

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Was quite distracted today thinking about Dan Koe's advice on the One-Person Value Creator Business model. But managed to make some progress here

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 12: March 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Very little - extreme tiredness from buzzing head last night and 3 wakeups from Mila. But I managed to create the operate() func with type checking, and learn a little more git

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Type checking in JS functions - no native type checking, you have to do it in the function. TypeScript will be breezy! Also practiced git merge and git push --force to force my local changes onto remote repo if I'm the sole dev on the repo. Very dangerous otherwise!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired. I want my bed...But glad that I showed up today and kept this thing going! Booyah!

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 13: March 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS grid from learncssgrid.com, then created all elements in html and added basic CSS Grid layout for calculator.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: CSS Grid

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I managed this well. I started quite tired, with Mila watching a video on my bed. But after I taught Anezka and came back to this, I was in a much better state to focus, started by learning CSS Grid before I started implementing it - great step forward in my process!

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 14: March 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Refactored html classes; refactored js - encapsulated vars in varObj & removed unnecessary type-checks in op functions

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Refactoring code; working with git and dealing with lost code there

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired. Stressed about family not letting me work. Proud of the progress I'm making despite everything.

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 15: April 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling my html, but a bug remains with the footer, main and header sections overlapping when I shrink the window vertically. 

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: CSS alignment - not as easy as I thought!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm getting the hang of CSS, but I don't want to make it my main job! I MUCH prefer JS - proper programming!

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 16: April 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up js for all the number buttons to update the display, and restored some lost js with git

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Fixing lost code with git; setting up event handlers for buttons. I tried to encapsulate my event handlers with the help of AI chatgpt, but realized it was getting above my ability level so reverted back to global event handlers for now.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Good! I learned how to actually fix issues with git, inc. merging; and I experimented with AI to help me, and am getting good at prompting!

------------------------------------------------------




### Day 17: April 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of planning for the logic to make the calculator actually work

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: System architecture, planning and psuedocode, as well as sketching out steps in user stories

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Getting more confident in my planning and breaking a problem down into small parts

**Link(s) to work**: 
1. https://github.com/Sherab-Z/JS-Calculator/commit/18432b120b50212ba6011be5535647642eca6557


------------------------------------------------------


### Day 18: April 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Planned my logic in much greater detail, and solved how to manage the array to make the calculator work

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Planning program logic

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Spent too much time on getting the colors right in Notability, and ran out of time to actually implement my logic. Need to simplify my workflow, my systems, my app toolbox, etc

**Link(s) to work**: 
1. It's a Notability note in my ipad


------------------------------------------------------



### Day 19: April 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Began refactoring my logic in pseudocode, and started a logic tree to help work it out better

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Creating a logic tree

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Getting better at making sure things will work before I implement any code. This is essential - I've already spotted two major issues in the logic which I've fixed before getting into difficulties with the code

**Link(s) to work**: 
1. https://github.com/Sherab-Z/JS-Calculator/commit/4635cbf71bf79d890960a8b2374447e8255fed38


------------------------------------------------------



### Day 20: April 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Went backwards. Finished logic tree, then realized the whole basis of my logic is flawed - if I simply check and manipulate an array based on its number of el's, my code will be unreadable and it'll end up even more complicated too. So I have to scrap that whole approach and start over with working this out. I've sketched an object in pseudocode to hold the values instead, with one of its values being an operation array that receives the values, then outputs to an outputVal key. I haven't yet figured out whether or not this'll work, though.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Logic trees; The importance of starting with the big picture, and working down from there gradually. 

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I grabbed onto the idea of manipulating an array too soon, before really thinking about all of the implications of that first, and the alternative approaches available. Feeling rather deflated, as I thought I'd be well into coding by now. And instead, I'm back at the drawing board...I'm glad I'm taking the time to plan properly, though, as I'd be a LOT more frustrated if I only came to this realization after coding half of the project!

### Day 21: April 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Most of the time spent thinking through how to manipulate the variable keys in the calcObj. Then trying out a flowchart maker tool called creately.com. It makes diagraming and editing a LOT faster! So I'll be using that in future, instead of doing slowly it in Notability...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Using logic flowcharts, and using apps to streamline creating them

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Barely started my flowchart before fam burst in with Peta desperate for a break from the girls on her constantly. It's really hell sometimes, tyring to make any progress in my work, both learning and earning...

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 22: April 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Making major progress in understanding the needed logic and algorithic structure, and being able to articulate this in a flowchart on creately.com. 

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Deciding & designing program logic, and mapping that out in a flowchart diagram

**Thoughts & Feelings**: It's massively better to use a software like creately.com, as the editing process is simple drag&drop, etc, so my ideas can really flow...

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 23: April 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Another complete rewrite of my logic, and restart to my pseudocode. Decided to a ask chatGPT for an overview of the logic, and it showed me that I was off in my data modeling. I needed to add an input variable, as well as 'numA' and 'numB' - which are operands (I was making a dodgy State Machine, it turns out). I need an input, operator, operandA, operandB, modifier, result and state. The operator key grabs the input and stores it in operandA or operandB, depending on the state, etc...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Data models (input queue, state machine); AI prompting - checking its output critically, then reprompting when I spot something that's off; working with md files

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Even though I had to scrap literally all the logic planning I'd done before today, and I 'gave in' to using AI to help me, I actually feel it was the smart/right thing to do, as now I've thought deeply about how to build this thing, and so I can really dig into the AI's outputs and correct them to get what I need. It wasn't wasted time - just part of learning this thing well!

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 24: April 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Confirmed my object structure with AI tools, and began reworking my code to start applying this latest logical architecture. I also did some research into functional programming and whether to start applying it here, but chatGPT advised that it's still too early in my learning, and I'd better stay with OOP for now

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: AI prompting; Functional Programming vs OOP

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired, but happy that I'm keeping this going. Didn't make much forward progress in just over an hour, but resolved a few questions/concerns I had about the foundations of my approach to building this app & my learning path

1. https://github.com/Sherab-Z/JS-Calculator/commit/3fbb1650d04eb7b599cc4a0f1f2ec30443dbfa11


------------------------------------------------------



### Day 25: April 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Began actual coding again! Yay! I added an initializer function; encapsulated and completed adding all the event listeners; matched classes between html, css, js. Worked out some bugs after encapsulating the e.l.'s

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Encapsulation; html, css, js

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Happy to be on the coding road again :)

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 26: April 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Changed the buttons so that each button now sends its value from its html attribute, instead of setting their values in the js itself. This way my code will remain much more high-level, and I can just focus on the logic instead of details. I spent a long time refactoring my event listeners to make this work

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: The event listener is actually the function that is being called. And it's best call it just by its name, not with parentheses. AI proompting

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm getting good at proompting AI to help me build code!

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 27: April 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the vertical resizing issue in css; worked on my event handlers again, refactoring to use event parameters; tested and verified initialize() func.; started writing event handlers for number btns and AC btn

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Event Handling; Responsive css; git workflow; Learning with an AI tutor (Bing)

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Confident in my abilities at this level. If I don't know how, I can figure it out!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 28: April 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Massively refined and refactored my pseudocode: Broke it down based on button inputs, then current state ("input mode", etc), then actions to perform; Added state updates and output display instructions to the end of each IF block.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Writing program logic into psuedocode.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm flying along now! This is great, I've just done 90 minutes of pure, focussed programming work. HECK YEAH!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 29: April 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed turning my algorithm into proper pseudocode in about 45m.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Transforming algorithm --> pseudocode

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I feel pretty confident that this will work. It'll probably be missing some secondary functionality, similar to  the decimal issue I fixed already (should only accept one '.' button input per input value)...we'll see. I next have to refactor my js code to match the fundamental changes I've instituted in my new, tweaked logic.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 30: April 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my entire logic psuedocode to include converting number btn input strings to numbers, then processing and outputting as strings again. Also reworked some existing functions. And made sure it all works as before. 

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Refactoring code; VS Code keyboard shortcuts

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Getting pretty quick at this coding thing..I feel more and more proficient every day..

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 31: April 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my button event listeners to use the id's instead of classes, for the code to be more robust in case I change the classes later on; added a decimal limiter function so only one decimal can be added per input string. Still need to implement the processNumInput function so it displays the updated number on the UI correctly.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Refactoring code; AI code help (Bing) + critical eye on it; processing flows

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Confident, but I need to rest more so I'm better and faster at this

### Day 32: April 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed some bugs, limited digit inputs to 11 to fit on display, fixed decimal input so it's in processing flow of number inputs

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Bug fixing in logic, packaging code as a function to be reused elsewhere - when & how to do that

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Lovely feeling to be making progress and knocking out bug fixes

### Day 33: April 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Middle of a bug fix and refactor to remove type conversion. It's a mess! Numbers I input go into inputStr, but no longer show up on the display...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Major refactoring to remove redundancies. Maybe not the best idea in the middle of a project. I'm learning what's necessary and what's too much. The type conversion was making my code way too complicated and verbose, so I decided to remove it as it no longer even served a purpose after I realized I should just display the inputStr anyway, and not send it on to outObj. Oh well, I'm learning.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Frustration that this project has taken around 6 weeks already, and I'm still in the middle of it...but I just don't have enough solid blocks of time to focus on it solely, I'm trying to start a business at the same time, work, raise our girls, etc...BUT I do feel way more confident in actually being able to fix this bug, knowing how to navigate my code pretty easily - that's great!

### Day 34: April 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bunch of old projects and took screenshots for my portfolio site. Needed to reconnect local git to github for my Flexbox landing page project. Used chatGPT to guide me.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Troubleshooting in git; Updating CSS in old projects; Styling

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm really getting fast and efficient at running through old projects and fixing things quickly in CSS and HTML. I think I've become a pro at these now!

### Day 35: April 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Looked through old projects for my portfolio, to find which ones need finishing or fixing. Almost all of them! So I started finising my Note-Taker app from 3 years ago. So far I just have an overview of what needs done, and started editing var names. Also fixed a bug with referencing a newNote in the inputBoxObj.makeNote function.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Reviewing old code and updating it

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired. Was with fam all day in Prague, nightmare turned to loveliness, but I'm exhausted! Finally got to this, but very little time for it.
