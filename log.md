### Day 1: March 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I've worked on my 'Rock-Paper-Scissors + UI' project, and made massive progress! It has a few bugs, but I've been bashing them one-by-one all day...going great!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I feel really confident about my ability to find and fix bugs, and to write well-structured, well-doc'd code! I'm making excellent progress! :)

### Day 2: March 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bunch of bugs in js app; removed abstraction that was bloating a function and causing bugs - went from 2 functions with 20 lines of code, to 1 function with 2 lines(!).

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: The 'WET then DRY' Principle: 'Write Everything Twice, then Don't Repeat Yourself' - Only after you've copy-pasted a few times, should you abstract your code to make it more reusable. Otherwise you can waste your time making everything into an abstraction that never gets reused.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Confident about my pontential and my progress, but very nervous and angry about my family situation 'holding me back' from being able to make progress and reach being job-ready...

### Day 3: March 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not much - only had 50m in the day, then a sleepy 30m after girls in bed. But managed to eliminate a bunch of tasks that actually didn't need to be done, and started the 'display scores on UI' feature...

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to use the *rest parameter syntax* ( function myFunc(...myArg) {here's the rest} ) to allow a function to recieve any number of arguments and automatically convert them to an array for passing into the function body

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Proud that I'm still able to make a little progress towards my goals on a day when we struggled so much as a family.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 4: March 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished re-build & adding UI for 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game! At least, the game logic is sound...the styling still needs some work..

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Always start with an MVP! The *tiniest* change can take a loooong time to implement, and can break other features...

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Tired, slightly numb, but proud that I've reached my goal..and happy that I can now move on with the Odin course!

### Day 5: March 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started Etch-a-Sketch project. Already setup with git, and I went through other ss top-rated live examples for inspiration, noted my ideas and made a plan, then started writing that in my pseudo.md

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Never try to develop when you're tired...but if you have to, then at least only do light work like this ;)

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm SUPER tired, literally falling asleep right now as I type...but it's great that I'm doing this 100DaysOfCode challenge, bc otherwise I def wouldn't be keeping up this much momentum!

### Day 6: March 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed my plan for building the 'Etch-a-Sketch' project - wrote up pseudo.md

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Project planning at the beginning, drawing a sketch on paper, breaking down the task into smaller pieces and working out the steps in each one

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Much more confident about starting this project than previous ones

------------------------------------------------------

### Day 7: March 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Made a more detailed wireframe with html elements, id's and classes, etc. And started building out the html - which went a lot faster and smoother due to the above planning I've put in.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Putting the time in to make a proper plan before I start writing the code...

**Thoughts & Feelings**: The increased confidence from having a more precise and detailed plan is massive!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 8: March 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Made basic layout work using position: absolute and flexbox. Began building JS canvas grid feature.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: CSS layouts, AI help.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Been slow today due to my overwhelming sadness I'm feeling due to traumas. But still  made progress.

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 9: March 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built drawOnCanvas() function with help of ChatGPT, with a lot of prompting back and forth

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to write and debug a function using chatGPT. It's not actually as easy as it seems.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Glad that I'm incorporating AI tools into my learning, both to learn faster and to get ready to use these tools irl.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 1: March 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed a feature on the Etch-a-Sketch project: New Canvas btn now prompts user for their choice of pen thickeness and validates it, then app converts this into a grid side lenght number, and creates a new canvas from that.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: JS functions, event handlers, state management

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Gutted that I missed posting my code to Twitter for 2 days, so I'm starting over again. But I did do 1h of coding each day, so that's good.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 2: March 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I tried building settings button that cycles between 4 pen width options, but realized it will take a lot more thought than I first realized. My code became buggy as hell, so I git reset it. Oh well.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Always, always, ALWAYS plan a feature before you start building it!

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Somewhat demoralized & frustrated, but I'm learning. And the pressure is on to start earning from this stuff, so that's not helping me to learn well...

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 3: March 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added a pen width button and icons that resize responsively based on the canvas size. Took a long time to do just that, and the button still doesn't do anything!

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: How to resize an element responsively based on the size of another element.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Feels good to be able to read through my code and pretty-much know what's going on everywhere. Also frustrating that I haven't planned this project out very well again, but issues and ideas have been occurring along the way which I didn't have enough experience to anticipate at the start.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 4: March 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed my project and pushed it to main remote branch, and moved on to the next chapter on Objects and Arrays in The Odin Project.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Basics of Objects, and Array methods for...in, map, filter, sort, key in obj

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I've covered quite a bit today, even though I only did small bits of actual coding. It was quite a good learning day!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 5: March 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the reading and started the Assignment for Fundamentals 5 chapter on Odin.

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Practiced using array methods on Wes Bos JS 30 course: reduce, some, every, find, and findIndex.

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Upbeat and confident in my coding skills. It was pretty easy to apply the methods, the hard part is figuring out what the actual problem is I'm trying to solve, breaking it down into smaller chunks/steps, and only THEN building effective solutions to each one - basically, PSEUDOCODE.

------------------------------------------------------



### Day 6: March 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started & completed 09-palindromes exercise in JS Arrays practice. I coded it without array methods at first - and passed all the tests - not being sure which array methods to use. Then I watched a video by Mosh on map() method, and he used it with filter() first, and I realized that's what I could use to refactor my code - and it works perfectly, and is much easier to read!

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: map() and filter() methods for JS arrays

**Thoughts & Feelings**: I'm happy that I'm growing my understanding of what's actually going underneath the code and it's top-level functionalities, into the underlying logic that runs it - data types, this method copies vs modifies an array, etc.

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 7: March 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed ex. 10_fibonacci, from start to finish this time :)

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Array methods: slice, reduce, push, pop. Using a combo of array methods to manipulate an array to produce the result I need, and doing so largely in my head! 

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Gaining confidence in working with arrays!

------------------------------------------------------


### Day 8: March 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: It's saturday, so I've been out with family and only started programming after 9pm. So my brain is mush. I managed to complete an easy array function-building exercise - getTheBook(), which takes an array of book objects and returns an array of the titles (used map method). But then spent over 45m staring at the screen not being able to figure out getTheOldest using reduce or sort().pop(). 

**Today I Learned/Practiced**: Array.map(), Array.reduce(), Array.sort()

**Thoughts & Feelings**: Frustrated that I spent so long getting nothing done, but accepting more that I just CANT do this after 9pm, especially after spending a long time with my family (Mila in particular)
